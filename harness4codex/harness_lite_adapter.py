"""Thin harness-lite supervisor adapter (harness-lite P100-T04).

Translates a classification, a spec and a plan into one request the execution
plane understands. It does not route: the router lives in the control plane,
and two adapters that each decided routing would be two routers, with the
looser of them being the one that gets used.

Generated under harness-lite decision B10, which says this arrives as a patch
so it is reviewable before it touches the tool doing the reviewing.

Standard library only, matching the rest of this package.
